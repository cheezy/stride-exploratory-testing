name: heuristics
description: Use when you need concrete test ideas — a named lens to get unstuck, decide what to vary, or systematically walk a feature. This is the plugin's single source of truth for heuristics: the general and web cheat sheets, the variable-spotting catalog, and Whittaker's Tours grouped by district. Every other skill and agent links here rather than duplicating the catalog. Invoked by the exploratory-testing orchestrator, the explorer subagent, and the /explore command whenever a charter needs to be turned into specific probes.

# heuristics

Heuristics are the engine that turns a charter into concrete experiments. A heuristic is a **fallible idea generator** — a named lens that suggests what to try next. None is a rule; each is a prompt. You apply them inside the design/execute/learn/steer loop: pick a lens, generate a probe, run it, and let what you learn choose the next lens.

**This file is the canonical catalog.** Other skills and agents reference these lenses *by name* (e.g. "apply Goldilocks and Follow the Data") instead of re-listing them. When you add a heuristic, add it here.

## How to use this catalog

1. Start from the charter's target and the information you're chasing.
2. Scan the **General Heuristics** for lenses that fit the target; when the charter follows a change (a diff, a feature, a fix), start with its **change-risk lenses**, whose *When it applies* cell names the kind of change that calls for each.
3. If it's a web/HTTP surface, add the **Web Heuristics**, including its change-risk lenses.
4. Use the **Variable Catalog** to decide *what to vary* within a chosen lens.
5. Use the **Tours** when you want a themed walkthrough of a whole area rather than a single probe.

Two working rules:

- **Web-only lenses don't apply to non-web targets.** If the charter's target is a CLI, a library, or a background job, skip the Web Heuristics section — forcing URL/cookie lenses onto a non-web target generates noise, not risk.
- **Disambiguate overlapping lenses.** Some lenses are refinements of others: **Zero, One, Many** is the general count lens; the standalone **Zero** case (empty collection, null, "" , 0) is the single most productive slice of it — call out which you mean. **Goldilocks** (too big / too small / just right) overlaps **Too Many, Too Few** — use Goldilocks for a single value's magnitude, Too Many/Too Few for the size of a collection.

## General Heuristics

| Heuristic | What to try |
|---|---|
| **Zero, One, Many** | A collection with zero items, exactly one, and many. Zero and one expose the empty-state and singular-plural bugs. |
| **Goldilocks** | A value that is too big, too small, and just right. Push both extremes and the boundary between them. |
| **Some, None, All** | For selections, filters, permissions, bulk actions: choose some, none, and all. |
| **CRUD** | Exercise Create, Read, Update, and Delete on each entity — and combinations (delete then read, update a deleted item). |
| **Follow the Data** | Create a datum, then read / update / delete it from every place it surfaces. Verify it stays consistent end to end. |
| **Interrupt** | Cancel, close the tab, log off, navigate away, or let a request time out **mid-operation** — by in-app means only. Restart or kill only a process you started yourself; never another process, the network, or the host. |
| **Reverse** | Do the steps in the opposite order; undo then redo; navigate backward through a wizard. |
| **Starve** | Deny resources by in-app means only: exhaust an app-level quota or rate limit with disposable test data, or throttle or shrink a limit through the app's own settings or a feature flag you may change in the environment you were given, restored afterwards. Never change operating-system, memory, disk, CPU or network resources, and never touch another host. |
| **Violate Format** | Feed values that break the expected format — wrong type, encoding, delimiter, length, or schema. |
| **Beginning, Middle, End** | Act at the start, the middle, and the end of a sequence, range, document, or list — boundaries live at the seams. |
| **Centralize / Decentralize** | Put everything in one place (one giant record, one account) vs. spread thin across many. |
| **Change the Model** | Vary the mental model: a different role, locale, currency, unit, time zone, or workflow than the "happy" one assumed. |
| **Zoom In / Zoom Out** | Examine a single item in fine detail; then step back to the aggregate, the report, the whole-system view. |
| **Too Many, Too Few** | Exceed and undershoot expected quantities and configured limits (max upload count, min required fields). |
| **Back, Forward, History** | Navigate backward and forward, replay history, resubmit a prior step. |
| **Bookmark It** | Capture a deep state (a saved link, a mid-flow token) and return to it later, out of order, or from a fresh session. |

### General change-risk lenses

Pick these by the kind of change under test: each row's *When it applies* names the change that calls for it. They refine lenses above — **Pull the Rug** is an Interrupt-style lens and shares its in-app limits (see *Safety of security-flavored heuristics*), **Developer Guidebook** extends the **Guidebook Tour**, **Every Locale** sharpens **Change the Model** and the Geography / locale variable, and **Who Else Is Watching** generalizes **Multiple Tabs / Windows**.

| Heuristic | What to try | When it applies |
|---|---|---|
| **Change the Rights** | Downgrade, restore or remove the user's role, membership or plan from a second session while their view stays open, then act in that view: every control, count and save must honour the new rights, not those loaded when the page opened. E.g. remove a test member from a shared workspace you created, then edit an item from the member's still-open view. | When a change touches roles, membership, plans, quotas or anything else that gates what a user may do. |
| **Shadow Decision** | List every place the client re-decides what the server decides — an enabled or hidden control, a "remaining" count, a detected file type, a plan badge — and make the two disagree; the server's answer is the truth and the client must follow it. E.g. fill a quota to one below its limit from another session, then use the still-enabled add button twice. | When a change adds, moves or duplicates a rule the server enforces and the client also displays or pre-checks. |
| **Who Else Is Watching** | For each mutation, list every open view that shows the changed data — other tabs, other users, lists, counters, badges, notifications — and check each refreshes, or is plainly marked stale, without a reload. E.g. rename a record in one session and watch its title in a second user's list, detail view and breadcrumb. | When a change adds or alters a create, update or delete, or a real-time broadcast. |
| **Pull the Rug** | By in-app means only, on test data you created, delete, archive or move the parent of a view that is still open — the folder of an open document, the project of an open task — then act in the child view: save, navigate, refresh. E.g. from a second tab, delete a folder you created while a document inside it is open for editing, then save the document. | When a change adds or alters a child view, a nested route, or a delete or move of a parent entity. |
| **Every Surface** | Enumerate every place that renders or edits the entity — each route, page, template, modal, list, archive or history view, alternate edit route, export, email, API response and CLI output — and check the change reached each one. E.g. after adding a field to a record's edit form, look for it on the archived-record view and in the bulk-edit dialog. | When a change alters how an entity is displayed, validated or edited. |
| **Every Locale** | Read each new or changed string in every shipped locale: plural forms, formal or informal register, number, date and size formats, text that grows past its space, and CJK punctuation where fragments are joined. E.g. in each shipped language, view "1 file", "2 files" and a size such as 1.5 MB. | When a change adds or edits user-visible text, a message built from fragments, or a formatted number, date or size. |
| **Developer Guidebook** | Extend the **Guidebook Tour** to developer-facing documents — module docs, design docs, the README and the changelog: each claim they make about the change is a probe, and each gap between claim and behaviour is a finding. E.g. a changelog line says deleting a list archives its items; delete a list you created and look for its items in the archive. | When a change ships with, or should have shipped with, module docs, a design doc or a changelog entry. |
| **Leave No Trace** | After the feature, or its test suite, has run, look for residue it left behind in places you are permitted to read — temp files, uploads, generated reports, cache or lock files, leftover jobs — and record it rather than deleting it. E.g. run an export once, then list the app's temp and upload directories for files that outlived it. | When a change writes files, starts background jobs, or adds tests that create disk state. |
| **Telemetry Semantics** | For each event, metric or log line the change emits, check that it fires exactly when its name says, once, with the documented fields and units — not on a failed attempt, a retry or a reload. E.g. an order-completed event should not fire when payment fails or when the confirmation page is reloaded. | When a change adds or alters telemetry, metrics, audit logs or analytics events. |

## Web Heuristics

Apply these when the target is a web/HTTP surface. (Skip for non-web targets.)

| Heuristic | What to try |
|---|---|
| **Tamper the URL** | Edit the path, query params, and record IDs of **your own** app to probe access control and input validation. |
| **Back / Forward / Resubmit** | Browser back after a submit, forward into a stale page, double-submit a form, F5 on a POST. |
| **Deep Link / Bookmark** | Enter mid-flow through a saved deep link — unauthenticated, out of sequence, or after the underlying record changed. |
| **Refresh / Reload** | Reload during a long operation; reload after partial input; reload a page whose data has since changed. |
| **Multiple Tabs / Windows** | Two tabs sharing one session; concurrent edits of the same record; log out in one tab while acting in another. |
| **Cookies / Session** | Let the session time out mid-action; clear, expire, or tamper cookies; act with a stale CSRF token. |
| **Special Characters & Injection** | Unicode, emoji, RTL marks, long strings, and HTML/script/SQL metacharacters in inputs — observe how they're escaped, encoded, or stored. Framed for **authorized testing of your own system only**; keep payloads illustrative and non-destructive. |
| **Copy / Paste / Autocomplete** | Paste rich or multi-line text, browser autofill, and values with leading/trailing whitespace. |
| **Resize / Zoom / Responsive** | Narrow viewport, high browser zoom, orientation change — layout, focus order, and hidden-control bugs. |

### Web change-risk lenses

Chosen the same way, for web/HTTP targets only. **After the Headers** is an Interrupt-style lens and shares its in-app limits; **Other Verbs** extends **Tamper the URL** from the path to the method and headers.

| Heuristic | What to try | When it applies |
|---|---|---|
| **Other Verbs** | Send the route ordinary requests with other methods and headers — HEAD, OPTIONS, a Range header, a conditional If-None-Match or If-Modified-Since — and check that status, headers and body agree with GET. Framed for **authorized testing of your own system only**. E.g. a HEAD on a new download route should return GET's headers with no body, and a Range request either a correct 206 or a plain 200. | When a change adds or alters a route, a download, or a cached or streamed response. |
| **After the Headers** | By in-app means only, fail the source of a streamed response after its status and headers are committed: change or delete the disposable test record or file it is streaming through the app's own UI or API, or cancel the job that feeds it. Observe it on a **real server** with a client that shows the raw response — an in-process test adapter buffers the response and cannot see that window. E.g. start a large export of test data you created, delete its source from another session mid-stream, and see whether the client receives a truncated file under a 200. | When a change adds or alters a streamed, chunked or long-running response. |
| **Response Hardening** | Check the security headers on every response type the change can produce — HTML, JSON, downloads, redirects, error pages, not-found pages — not only the main page: content security policy, framing, content-type sniffing, caching of private data, cookie flags. Framed for **authorized testing of your own system only**: send ordinary requests and read the headers. E.g. compare a new download's headers with a normal page's, looking for a private file served with a public cache header. | When a change adds a route, a response type, a file download or an error path. |

## Variable Catalog

When a lens says "vary it," this catalog says *what dimensions exist to vary*. Spot the variables in the target, then push each one with the general heuristics above.

| Variable | Dimensions to push |
|---|---|
| **Count** | Number of items: zero, one, many, too many, exactly at the limit. |
| **Position** | Where in a sequence or range: beginning, middle, end, just inside/outside a boundary. |
| **Files & storage** | File type, size, name (Unicode, spaces, very long), permissions, missing / locked / corrupt / zero-byte. |
| **Geography / locale** | Country, language, time zone, currency, number and address formats, right-to-left scripts. |
| **Format** | Encoding, delimiters, MIME type, schema version, structured vs. malformed. |
| **Size** | Length, magnitude, dimensions — empty, tiny, huge, at and beyond the maximum. |
| **Depth** | Levels of nesting or recursion — flat vs. deeply nested structures, self-reference. |
| **Timing / frequency / duration** | How fast, how often, how long — concurrency, ordering, races, retries, timeouts, very short and very long durations. |
| **Input / navigation method** | Keyboard vs. mouse vs. touch vs. API; the path taken through the UI; the entry point into a flow. |

## Tours

A **Tour** is a themed walkthrough of an area, biased toward one kind of risk — a way to cover a whole district with a consistent intent instead of a single probe. Whittaker groups tours by *tourist district*; pick the district whose risk matters for your charter.

### Business District — the features that deliver the most value
- **Guidebook Tour** — follow the documentation/manual exactly; every gap or lie between docs and product is a finding.
- **Money Tour** — walk the features that sell the product or make the money; these deserve the most scrutiny.
- **Landmark Tour** — pick the "landmark" features and visit them in varied orders, mapping the paths between them.
- **Intellectual Tour** — ask the software the hardest questions it should be able to answer (max inputs, edge configurations).
- **FedEx Tour** — follow a piece of data like a package from entry to every place it's stored, transformed, and displayed.
- **Garbage Collector's Tour** — visit every screen/field methodically, shortest-path, leaving nothing unvisited.
- **After-Hours Tour** — exercise what runs when users are away: batch jobs, backups, scheduled tasks, end-of-day processing.

### Historical District — old and previously-broken code
- **Bad-Neighborhood Tour** — revisit the areas where bugs have clustered before; defects breed near defects.
- **Museum Tour** — exercise legacy features and old code paths that survived into the current version.
- **Prior Version Tour** — rerun scenarios that worked in the last release, hunting regressions.

### Tourist District — features you visit quickly to gawk
- **Collector's Tour** — collect every output, result, and message the software can produce; enumerate the range.
- **Lonely Businessman Tour** — follow the longest, most convoluted path a determined user might take.
- **Supermodel Tour** — attend only to the surface: layout, styling, labels, focus, animation — pure UI.
- **Scottish Pub Tour** — seek out the obscure, hidden, and hard-to-find features nobody advertises.

### Entertainment District — supporting features
- **Supporting Actor Tour** — test the features adjacent to the main ones (the fields and controls next to the star feature).
- **Back Alley Tour** — exercise the least-used, least-loved features — the ones most likely under-tested.
- **All-Nighter Tour** — never close or log off; keep the app running for a long time to surface leaks and stale state.

### Hotel District — the "resting" features
- **Rained-Out Tour** — start operations and then cancel, pause, or abandon them; poke what happens when nothing finishes.
- **Couch Potato Tour** — do as little as possible: accept every default, leave fields blank, click straight through.

### Seedy District — the mean, nasty tours
- **Saboteur Tour** — actively try to break it by in-app means: corrupt the input, cancel or abandon a flow at the worst moment, exhaust an app-level quota with disposable test data — never pull the network, kill a process you did not start, or touch the operating system or another host.
- **Antisocial Tour** — do the opposite of what's expected — the least-likely inputs and out-of-order actions.
- **Obsessive-Compulsive Tour** — repeat the same action over and over; redo, resubmit, re-enter; do it again immediately.

## Safety of security-flavored heuristics

The injection and Saboteur-style lenses are for **authorized testing of a system you own or are permitted to test** — never for attacking third parties. Keep example payloads clearly illustrative and non-destructive; this catalog contains no live exploit code targeting external systems, and neither should the probes you derive from it.

**Interrupt, Starve and the Saboteur Tour are limited to in-app means**: cancel through the UI or API, close the tab, log off, let a request time out, throttle through an app setting or feature flag you are permitted to change in the environment you were given (never shared state, and restored afterwards), or exhaust an app-level quota with disposable test data. Never kill a process you did not start, never change operating-system, network or other system resources, and never touch a host outside the authorized target.

**Pull the Rug and After the Headers share the Interrupt limits**: pull the rug or fail a streamed source only through the app's own UI or API, on test data you created. Never kill the server or a process you did not start, never drop or slow the network, and never touch another host. **Other Verbs and Response Hardening** are for authorized testing of your own system only: send ordinary requests to the authorized target and read what comes back — no scanners, no floods, no other host.

## Handing off

The `chartering` skill decides *what* to explore; this skill supplies the lenses to probe it; the `oracles` skill decides whether what you observed is a *problem*; the `session` skill wraps it all in a time-boxed session. Reach for a Tour when you want breadth over an area, and a single heuristic when you want depth on a specific risk.
