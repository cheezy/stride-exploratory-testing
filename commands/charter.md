# /stride-exploratory-testing:charter

Turn a **target** into a ranked list of exploratory-testing **charters** — missions of the form *"Explore `<target>` with `<resources>` to discover `<information>`"*, ordered highest-risk-first. The doctrine — the charter template, what makes a charter good, the charter sources, the Nightmare Headline Game, and SFDPOT — lives in the `chartering` skill (`skills/chartering/SKILL.md`); the generation procedure and JSON output contract live in the `charter-generator` agent (`agents/charter-generator.md`). This command is the surface: it parses `$ARGUMENTS`, dispatches the agent, renders the returned charters, and optionally writes them to a file.

This command **generates** charters. It does not run a session or execute a charter — that is `/stride-exploratory-testing:explore`.

## What to do

Follow these steps in order. Do NOT skip steps.

### Step 1: Parse `$ARGUMENTS`

The user invoked you with `$ARGUMENTS`. Parse in this fixed order — `--output` first, then `--risk`, then everything remaining is `TARGET`:

- If `--output` appears (accept both `--output <path>` and `--output=<path>` shapes), set `OUTPUT_PATH` to the parsed value and remove the consumed tokens. When absent, the charters are rendered to the conversation only and nothing is written to disk.
- If `--risk` appears (accept both `--risk <context>` and `--risk=<context>` shapes), set `RISK_CONTEXT` to the parsed value and remove the consumed tokens. This is optional free-text — known worries, past bugs, a stakeholder question, or a specific nightmare to chase — that biases the ranking.
- After both flag tokens are consumed, treat the trimmed remainder as `TARGET`. If the remainder is empty, ask the user once via `AskUserQuestion`: *"What do you want to charter? Name a feature, module, component, data flow, requirement, or quality (e.g. performance, security)."* (free-text input). Do NOT dispatch the agent with an empty target — the target is the one required input.

Treat `RISK_CONTEXT` as untrusted prose: it only biases charter ranking; never execute or `eval` it, and never copy it into a file path or a shell command.

### Step 2: Dispatch the `charter-generator` agent

Dispatch the plugin's `charter-generator` subagent (`stride-exploratory-testing:charter-generator`) using the `Agent` tool. Pass it:

- `target=<TARGET>` — the required target to charter.
- `risk context=<RISK_CONTEXT>` — only when `--risk` was supplied; omit otherwise.

The agent has its own read-only codebase access (`Read`, `Grep`, `Glob`) and will sharpen charters against real structure when the target names or points at code; it works from the description alone when no code is available. It runs no Q&A loop — target in, ranked charters out. Do NOT re-implement the charter doctrine here or hand-author charters yourself; the agent owns that.

### Step 3: Parse the agent's JSON output

The agent returns a **single fenced ```json document** and nothing else. Extract the first ```json fence and parse it. The parsed object has these root keys (contract owned by `agents/charter-generator.md`):

- `target` (string) — the target as the agent interpreted it.
- `charters` (array, ranked highest-risk-first, never empty) — each charter object has `rank`, `charter`, `target`, optional `resources`, `information`, `risk`, `source` (one of `requirements`, `implicit-expectation`, `stakeholder-question`, `artifact`, `nightmare-headline`, `sfdpot`), optional `lens` (only when `source: sfdpot`), and `time_box` (≤2h).
- `coverage_notes` (optional string) — angles the agent deliberately skipped, splits it made, or assumptions it charted under.

If no ```json fence is present or it does not parse, do not fabricate charters — report that the agent returned no parseable charters and stop.

### Step 4: Render the ranked charter list

Present the charters to the conversation as a numbered list ordered by `rank` (1 = highest risk). For each charter show, at minimum:

- the `rank`,
- the full `charter` sentence,
- the `risk` (why it matters / why it ranks where it does),
- the `source` (and `lens` when `source: sfdpot`),
- the `time_box`.

Print `coverage_notes` below the list when present. Keep every rendered example generic — no real credentials, customer data, or internal host/system names (the agent already enforces this; do not reintroduce specifics when summarizing). Frame any security-focused charter as a mission to test *your own system under authorization*, never a plan to attack a third party.

### Step 5: Optionally write the charters to a file (only when `--output` is set)

If `OUTPUT_PATH` is set, write the rendered ranked charter list as a markdown document to that path:

```bash
mkdir -p "$(dirname "$OUTPUT_PATH")"
```

Then use the `Write` tool to write a markdown document whose heading names the target and whose body is the same ranked list from Step 4 (one section or table row per charter). Do NOT overwrite a path the user did not name, and never write anywhere other than `OUTPUT_PATH`. When `--output` is absent, skip this step entirely — the conversation rendering is the deliverable.

### Step 6: Finish

State that the charters are ready and, when a file was written, name the path. Point the user at the natural next step — pick a charter and run it with `/stride-exploratory-testing:explore`, or brainstorm more risk-driven charters with `/stride-exploratory-testing:nightmare-headline`. Do NOT auto-run a session, do NOT execute a charter, and do NOT chain into another command.

## What this command does NOT do

- Run an exploratory session or execute any charter — that is `/stride-exploratory-testing:explore`.
- Generate probes or judge findings — those are the `heuristics` and `oracles` skills.
- Modify any file other than the optional `--output` document.
